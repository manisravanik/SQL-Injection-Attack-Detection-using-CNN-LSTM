SQL Injection is said to be one of the top most threat that database-based applications face on the web. SQL Injection makes all the userâ€˜s information present in the database vulnerable and
the user's data may be misused. This project aims to detect SQL Injection Attack using a hybrid model CNN-LSTM. There are many machine learning models which are used to detect this attack 
but with low accuracy. In this work, 99.22% accuracy is achieved.
